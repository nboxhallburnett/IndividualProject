\section{Non-Standard Geometry in Game Engines}
\label{lr:ne}

\begin{multicols*}{2}
	\subsection{Introduction}
	\label{lr:ne:intro}
%		In this section I will introduce the concept of non-standard geometry, e.g. non-Euclidean, and review existing literature regarding its use in video game engines.
	
	\subsection{Existing Examples}
	\label{lr:ne:existing}
%		Here I will cover literature around non-Euclidean geometry, as well as existing examples of such geometry in virtual environments.
		(PLACEHOLDER) The following sources will be discussed in this section:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{Maric2014} - Formalizing complex plane geometry
			\item \cite{Turner2009} - Mathematics and the Imagination
			\item \cite{Lindley2005} - Game space design foundations for trans-reality games
		\end{itemize}
		
	\subsection{Conclusion}
	\label{lr:ne:conclusion}
		This section will be used to sum up the sources discussed above, how relevant and reliable they are as sources, and how they relate to my project.
