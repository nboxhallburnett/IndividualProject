	% TODO - This is the one bit where you can talk in the first person, so go wild.

	% Talk about how I was originally wanting to do an experiment about the effects of calibration on people in VR, but that guy had already reserached that stuff to death
	% So you decided to do a mix of your original proposal with that one.

	% Talk about how you originally wanted to write your own engine for it in C++ / DirectX, but a mixture of time and priorities made you decide to use an existing engine you knew well instead (save time reinventing the wheel for things like lighting, camera stuff, etc)
	% Also you wanted to limit the amount of outside variables as possible, so an existing engine helped with that

	% Talk about being happy with the amount of data you recieved, and how the results went against your original expectations for the results (which is a good thing!)

	% Talk about how you could have repeated the experiment with the feedback but with different navigation methods to see how that effects immersion - room for further study

	% Talk about how well the effect looked in the end (even though it took a long time to get 'right')

	% Talk about the downside of using the existing engine with the weird positioning stuff that oculus was doing with the camera, giving it a really slight crack in the margins, and how it looks fine when not using the rift

	% Conclude about how you were happy with the overall product, but it could have been more in depth
