\chapter[Product]{Product Design and Implementation}
\label{design}

	\section{Introduction}
		Here I will give an overview of the following sections.

	\section{Tools}
		This section will cover the various tools I used to complete the product itself, and why I chose them as opposed to any alternatives.

	\section{Product model}
		This section will contain models of the various states and relations between the functions and other workings of the product, for areas such as the transition between non-Euclidean world areas.

	\section{Design of experiment environments}
		Here I will be covering the designs of the various areas of the virtual environments to be used in the experiments themselves, and why they are applicable for use for the tests.
