\chapter[Product]{Design and Implementation}
\label{design}

\begin{multicols*}{2}

	\section{Introduction}
		% TODO - Here I will give an overview of the following sections.

	\section{Tools}
		% TODO - This section will cover the various tools I used to complete the product itself, and why I chose them as opposed to any alternatives.

		% Talk about how you decide to use an existing engine you knew well (save time reinventing the wheel for things like lighting, camera stuff, etc)
		% Also you wanted to limit the amount of outside variables as possible, so an existing engine helped with that

	\section{Product model}
		% TODO - This section will contain models of the various states and relations between the functions and other workings of the product, for areas such as the transition between non-Euclidean world areas.

			Red lines are connections between points,
			yellow lines are connections visible to the player,
			and green lines are the direction the connectors are facing}

	\section][Environment Design]{Design of experiment environments}
		% TODO - Here I will be covering the designs of the various areas of the virtual environments to be used in the experiments themselves, and why they are applicable for use for the tests.
