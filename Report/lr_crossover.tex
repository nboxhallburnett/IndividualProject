\section[Non-Standard Geometry in Game Engines, and VR Applications]{Non-Standard Geometry in Game Engines, and the Application of VR in Non-Euclidean worlds}
\label{lr:cross}

	% In this section I will introduce the concept of non-standard geometry, e.g. non-Euclidean, and review existing literature regarding its use in video game engines.

	% In this section I will introduce the concepts to be covered in this section, namely how one can apply the key concepts for perception and presence in VR to a game world using non-standard geometry.

	\subsection{Existing Examples}
	\label{lr:ne:existing}

		% TODO:  So yeah, here you'll just need to talk about how there really isn't any existing literature regarding non-Euclidean geometry in virtual environments. probably a good idea to mention how this is not a bad thing, as it means there is plenty of room for the project, and makes the project worthwhile?

	\subsection{Application}
	\label{lr:cross:application}

		% Here I will be covering any existing research which relates to the combination of VR and non-Euclidean geometry.
		% TODO: The following sources will be discussed in this section:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \cite{Cruz-Neira1993} - Surround-screen projection-based virtual reality
			\item As referenced in \ref{lr:vr:perception}, \cite{Wright2014} - Using virtual reality to augment perception, enhance sensorimotor adaptation, and change our minds - Discuss how it could also relate to sensorimotor adaptations allowing a user to get accustomed to existing i\textsl{}n a non-Euclidean world.
		\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Tools \& Techniques}
	\label{lr:cross:tools}

		% This section will cover tools which are applicable for the creation of VR/Non-Euclidean virtual environments.

		\cite{Bruce2012} - Custom engine v modify an existing one - debate. Compares the pros and cons of both modifying an existing engine and creating a custom solution. ('Leaky Abstractions' with an existing engine, balance engine efficiency and actual system development with a custom engine, etc.).
		
	\subsection{Summary}
	\label{lr:cross:conclusion}
		% There is a severe lack of academic research into non-standard geometry in virtual environments
		% This section will sum up the points discussed in the above subsections.
		% TODO: Sum up the points discussed in the above sections. Example: current implementations of non-euclidean geometry in released games have always directly used, or modified an existing generic game engine to create the VE, and are therefore not optimised to be used in a non-euclidean world.
