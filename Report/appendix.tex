	\section{Code Samples}
	\label{appendix:code}

		Below are code snippets for sections or complete functions that have specifically been referenced in the body of the report.

if (!Inverse) {

}

// Set the near clipping plane of the camera to only render starting from the closest visible area
_cam.nearClipPlane = (Helper.FindClosestPoint(_bounds, transform.position) - transform.position).magnitude / 2f;

	\section{Ethics Review}
	\label{appendix:ethics}
		A completed and signed copy of the Project Ethical Review Form can be found on the following two pages.

		\includepdf[pages={-},scale=0.9]{"../Ethical Review Scan"}

	\section{Questionnaire}
	\label{appendix:question}
		A blank copy of the form used to gather the feedback discussed in Chapter \ref{exp} can be seen in the following two pages. The completed versions of the forms containing the raw data gathered are available upon request. Either the 1 or 2 were highlighted under the 'Experiment' section at the top of each page before being given to a participant, as a reference to which experiment the form was for, without indicating to the participant the nature of the experiment.
